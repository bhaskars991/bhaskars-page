## Hi, Welcome to Bhaskar's Page!

I love to build software products with modern technology stacks. To accomplish this, I work with the software team to improve communication and responsibility within the team. With measured steps towards quality releases, I have been able to create high quality software products. 

I have enjoyed many senior level positions in my career as a developer, architect, technical program manager and engineering manager These experiences have taught me the following about myself. 

I can successfully lead and grow development team from 5 to 50 engineers. I excel at the execution of big ideas shaping the new product with the given resource and funding constraints. I like to work with data to guide my decisions. 

I drive myself to be a better, more refined person every day. I am constantly learning because the world of software development is rapidly changing. I like to approach problems from a customer perspective. I stay calm on stormy days and focus on making good decisions..
