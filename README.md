## Hi, Welcome to Bhaskar's Page!

I love to build software products with modern technology stacks. I love to work with talented engineers so work is fun and a learning experience. With my team's help, I have been able to create some high quality software products. 

I have enjoyed many senior level positions in my career as a developer, architect, program manager and engineering manager. These experiences have taught me the several things about myself. 

In software development, it is better to keep a long term perspective, because everyday is a battle, some days are easy, while others are a hard. Team work is everything, unless everyone is playing its hard to move the needle.  

I drive myself to be a better, more refined person every day. I am constantly learning because the world of software development is rapidly changing. I try to stay calm on stormy days and focus on making good decisions..
